**< Thoughts >**

• As a first time #100Dev'er, I was pulled into Leon's lecture almost immediately. He was extremely real and honest about how he felt. His willingness to help others break into tech without spending tons of money (especially for those who can't afford it) is inspiring. 

• The YouTube video were helpful, and shocking. I've heard of active recall, but never knew the science behind it. Ali Abdaal provided references from where he got his information from and graphs to help us visually see the difference in learning styles. I really appreciated how this is one of the very first things we learn before moving forward in #100Devs.

### Day 47/100: June 28th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Finished Week 1 of 4 in "Learning How To Learn" <br>
• Took notes on Notion<br>


**< Thoughts >**

• I was intrigued with the differences between diffuse thinking and focused thinking and how they work TOGETHER to achieve a greater goal. The way both of the instructors used metaphors and analogies and taught us how it helps to retain information was so crucial in my future studies. So far everything the instructors provided have been super informative and great.
