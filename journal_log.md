**< Thoughts >**

• As a first time #100Dev'er, I was pulled into Leon's lecture almost immediately. He was extremely real and honest about how he felt. His willingness to help others break into tech without spending tons of money (especially for those who can't afford it) is inspiring. 

• The YouTube video were helpful, and shocking. I've heard of active recall, but never knew the science behind it. Ali Abdaal provided references from where he got his information from and graphs to help us visually see the difference in learning styles. I really appreciated how this is one of the very first things we learn before moving forward in #100Devs. 

**< Today's Plan >**

• Start and Finish Class 01 homework - Coursera course "Learning How To Learn" <br>

### Day 47/100: June 28th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Finished Week 1 of 4 in "Learning How To Learn" <br>
• Took notes on Notion<br>


**< Thoughts >**

• I was intrigued with the differences between diffuse thinking and focused thinking and how they work TOGETHER to achieve a greater goal. The way both of the instructors used metaphors and analogies and taught us how it helps to retain information was so crucial in my future studies. So far everything the instructors provided have been super informative and great.

• Finish Week 2 and 3 - Coursera course "Learning How To Learn" <br>

• Start Anki notes<br>

### Day 48/100: June 29th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Got halfway through Week 2 of 4 in "Learning How To Learn" <br>
• Took notes on Notion<br>


**< Thoughts >**

• I learned about chunking and how fitting little pieces of information can help understand the bigger picture of a concept. This was super helpful to learn about so I know moving forward how I can improve my studies. I now know that reading material and being able to recall, as well as, figuring out problems on my own rather than copying it from a tutorial will help the material stick much better. <br>
• My goal yesterday was to finish Week 2 and 3, along with writing Anki notes, however, between getting ready for vacation and catching up with some family it was hard to do before the night was over. <br>
• For "Learning How to Learn" I've decided I will not be making Anki cards for it. I want to use the Anki cards for everything programming that will be most important going forward. <br>


**< Today's Plan >**

• Finish Week 2 and 3 - Coursera course "Learning How To Learn" <br>
    - https://coursera.org/share/ace875e4dd605145d75886055799dee7 <br>

### Day 49/100: June 30th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Completed "Learning How To Learn" homework and submitted it <br>
• Took notes on Notion<br>


**< Thoughts >**

• The rest of "Learning How To Learn" was very informative. I learned a lot about procrastination and how to combat it with not only the Pomodoro technique, but simply getting into the habit of getting back on track whenever attention begins to wander. I also learned about memory and techniques, like using visuals and acronyms.


**< Today's Plan >**

• Watch Class 02 lecture <br>
• Take notes when needed <br>
• Attempt to begin the homework

### Day 50/100: July 1st, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Completed Class 02 lecture <br>
• Took Active Recall notes on Notion<br>


**< Thoughts >**

• Class 02 was great! Did some Active Recall from Class 01 information about what the web is and how it works. We then moved onto learning some tags and coding HTML. This involved a 10 minute exercise where Leon wrote out the content and we placed what tags we thought belonged where. I already know some HTML, but some of the tags he taught were things I didn't learn from The Odin Project where I began HTML/CSS learning. These where things like:
< aside, article, and selection > <br>
After 10 minutes were up, he went over it with us and explained why he chose the tags he did. 


**< Today's Plan >**

• Start Class 02 Homework: <br>
