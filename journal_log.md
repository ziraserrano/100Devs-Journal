### Day 46/100: June 27th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Started and finished Class 01 lecture on YouTube <br>
• Started and finished both YouTube video resources on Active Recall and Spaced Repetition<br>

    - https://youtu.be/Z-zNHHpXoMM <br>


**< Thoughts >**

• As a first time #100Dev'er, I was pulled into Leon's lecture almost immediately. He was extremely real and honest about how he felt. His willingness to help others break into tech without spending tons of money (especially for those who can't afford it) is inspiring. 

• The YouTube video were helpful, and shocking. I've heard of active recall, but never knew the science behind it. Ali Abdaal provided references from where he got his information from and graphs to help us visually see the difference in learning styles. I really appreciated how this is one of the very first things we learn before moving forward in #100Devs. 

**< Today's Plan >**

• Start and Finish Class 01 homework - Coursera course "Learning How To Learn" <br>

### Day 47/100: June 28th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Finished Week 1 of 4 in "Learning How To Learn" <br>
• Took notes on Notion<br>


**< Thoughts >**

• I was intrigued with the differences between diffuse thinking and focused thinking and how they work TOGETHER to achieve a greater goal. The way both of the instructors used metaphors and analogies and taught us how it helps to retain information was so crucial in my future studies. So far everything the instructors provided have been super informative and great.


**< Today's Plan >**

• Finish Week 2 and 3 - Coursera course "Learning How To Learn" <br>
    - https://coursera.org/share/ace875e4dd605145d75886055799dee7 <br>
• Start Anki notes<br>

### Day 48/100: June 29th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Got halfway through Week 2 of 4 in "Learning How To Learn" <br>
• Took notes on Notion<br>


**< Thoughts >**

• I learned about chunking and how fitting little pieces of information can help understand the bigger picture of a concept. This was super helpful to learn about so I know moving forward how I can improve my studies. I now know that reading material and being able to recall, as well as, figuring out problems on my own rather than copying it from a tutorial will help the material stick much better. <br>
• My goal yesterday was to finish Week 2 and 3, along with writing Anki notes, however, between getting ready for vacation and catching up with some family it was hard to do before the night was over. <br>
• For "Learning How to Learn" I've decided I will not be making Anki cards for it. I want to use the Anki cards for everything programming that will be most important going forward. <br>


**< Today's Plan >**

• Finish Week 2 and 3 - Coursera course "Learning How To Learn" <br>
    - https://coursera.org/share/ace875e4dd605145d75886055799dee7 <br>
• Submit Class 01 homework <br>
• Begin Class 02 lecture!<br>

---

### Day 49/100: June 30th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Completed "Learning How To Learn" homework and submitted it <br>
• Took notes on Notion<br>


**< Thoughts >**

• The rest of "Learning How To Learn" was very informative. I learned a lot about procrastination and how to combat it with not only the Pomodoro technique, but simply getting into the habit of getting back on track whenever attention begins to wander. I also learned about memory and techniques, like using visuals and acronyms.


**< Today's Plan >**

• Watch Class 02 lecture <br>
• Take notes when needed <br>
• Attempt to begin the homework

---

### Day 50/100: July 1st, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Completed Class 02 lecture <br>
• Took Active Recall notes on Notion<br>


**< Thoughts >**

• Class 02 was great! Did some Active Recall from Class 01 information about what the web is and how it works. We then moved onto learning some elements/tags and coding HTML. This involved a 10 minute exercise where Leon wrote out the content and we placed what tags we thought belonged where. I already know some HTML, but some of the elements/tags he taught were things I didn't learn from The Odin Project where I began HTML/CSS learning. These where things like:
< aside, article, and selection > <br>
After 10 minutes were up, he went over it with us and explained why he chose the tags he did. 


**< Today's Plan >**

• Start Class 02 Homework: <br>

### Day 51/100: July 2nd, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Worked through the first homework assignment <br>
link: https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/ <br>
• Coded along with the exercises from above<br>


**< Thoughts >**

• I find Shay Howe's lessons on HTML and CSS to be great and informative. It is very clear to understand and straight to the point! I know much of this already, but I still wanted to keep up with the exercises as a read along. <br>
• Tomorrow I leave for vacation and I'm not feeling too great (getting sick). Through out vacation, I'll be doing little sessions of coding and taking it easy.<br>



**< Today's Plan >**

• Continue with Shay Howe lessons below <br>

### Day 52/100: July 3rd, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Reached Lesson 3 on Shay Howe's HTML/CSS lessons <br>
link: https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/ <br>
• Coded along with the exercises from above<br>
• Typed out active recall questions on notion<br>


**< Thoughts >**

• I learned quite a bit yesterday and even came across some elements I haven't learned in other courses. I also find the exercises to be great practice and Shay Howe keeps the consistency by building on top of the previous lesson until we build a full website. I'm excited to see the outcome.<br>
• Today I will continue with Lesson 3 and dive into some CSS basics.<br>



**< Today's Plan >**

• Continue with Shay Howe lessons below <br>

### Day 53/100: July 5th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Yesterday (July 4th) I took a small break on learning and decided to type up some notes related to what I learned on July 3rd <br>


**< Thoughts >**

• I went into CSS with Shay Howe's lesson and re-learned a lot of things I already knew. I still want to keep at it for repetition and practice purposes.<br>



**< Today's Plan >**

• Today I attended a Front End meeting for HotSoup Open Source Project! We focused on setting up the files. It was mostly JS/TypeScript/React Native - things that I don't know right now. I kept up with it though and felt okay.<br>
• Before the night is over, I'm going to do a JavaScript Crash Course with Brad Travesy. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c) I purchased his Udemy courses a while ago, and have seen great reviews about his crash course. I want to try and get some knowledge of JavaScript as the open source project progresses along. My goal is to make some contributions to the project and get some hands-on learning!<br>

---

### Day 54/100: July 6th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Yesterday I got through half of the JavaScript Crash Course. <br>


**< Thoughts >**

• The crash course was super informative and I decided to try and get through the rest today. I learned quite a few things, but I'm not going to be able to retain much of it until I work with it more hands-on. <br>



**< Today's Plan >**

• So far I watched and coded along with some JavaScript in the crash course, but I decided to pause it for now. <br>
• I'm going to dive into Shay Howe's HTML/CSS lessons the rest of the day so I can move on in 100Devs and try to get to Class 03 lecture.<br>

---

### Day 55/100: July 7th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Worked on Shay Howe's HTML/CSS Lesson 4 <br>
• Got through most of Class 03 lecture with #100devs<br>
• Typed up notion class lecture notes<br>


**< Thoughts >**

• Leon is a beast. I know I am still barely touching the surface of coding with his HTML lessons, but I am super excited to get started the JavaScript and framework lessons!!  <br>
• With the Shay Howe lessons, I got through Lesson 4 The Box Model and learned something new that The Odin Project didn't teach in the fundamentals. That was the box-sizing property with the browser-specific vendor prefixes like -webkit- and -moz- .<br>



**< Today's Plan >**

• Today I am going to get through Class 03 lecture and start knocking out some homework. I'll probably start building the BBC with HTML only (Class 02 homework). I'm still on vacation so how much I can actually get done is up in the air! <br>
• If I am able to get done BBC website, I will go back to Shay Howe lessons and finish Lesson 5 and take notion notes.<br>

---

### Day 56/100: July 8th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• I finished Class 03 lecture <br>
• Coded some HTML for Tech Crunch website clone<br>
• Made a repo on github for BBC Website Clone - might go back and figure ,out if I should keep it, or add Tech Crunch and Khan Academy clones as well.<br>

**< Thoughts >**

• Because of my previous HTML/CSS knowledge, I feel like typing out the HTML code for Tech Crunch was a breeze! There's not much else I did yesterday. It was a busy vacation day. <br>


**< Today's Plan >**

• Today I am going to finish both Class 02 and Class 03 homework assignments and get them submitted <br>

---
### Day 57/100: July 10th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• I tried to get BBC, TechCrunch and Khan Academy codes submitted for the homework assignment, but was only able to do BBC. Glitch just stopped working for me and wouldn't load a new project. <br>
• Yesterday - July 9th - I got really busy with household chores and the kids. I wasn't able to get much done, so whatever free time I had I worked on the Shay Howe HTML/CSS lessons and wrote some active recall notes. I didn't count it as a day, because it just didn't feel right. To me, it wasn't as much of a productive day (for coding) to make it a day of code. <br>

**< Thoughts >**

• I just need glitch to work so I can submit my assignments!! <br>


**< Today's Plan >**

• Tonight, I am going to begin Class 04 and start writing active recall notes. Some light work After a long and exhausting Sunday! <br>

---

### Day 58/100: July 11th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Watched some Class 04 lecture before falling asleep. Nothing too crazy.<br>

**< Thoughts >**

• --- <br>


**< Today's Plan >**

• Finish out Class 04's lecture and take some notes <br>
• Try to start on the class assignments before the day is over<br>

---

### Day 59/100: July 12th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Productive day yesterday! I finished watching Class 04 lecture and wrote my notion active recall notes. <br>
• I also got done the Simple Site Lab homework assignment.<br>

**< Thoughts >**

• We dove into CSS in Class 04 and it was very informative. I was able to finish coding HTML/CSS Simple Site Lab from scratch and feel great about it.<br>
• I accomplished more than I planned to, putting me in a great position to start off today's new plans <br>
• Right now, my ultimate goal for this week is to get through Class 06 lecture & notes by Friday and get all coding and reading assignments done over the weekend so I can begin Class 07 by Monday. <br>


**< Today's Plan >**

• Start Class 05 lecture and write notion active recall notes.<br>
• IF I finish the lecture, I am going to try and knock out the homework assignment for Class 05.<br>

---

### Day 60/100: July 13th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Another productive day yesterday! I'm now moving onto Class 06 today. <br>
• I also got done the 3 layouts homework assignments and submitted all homework. <br>

**< Thoughts >**

• In Class 05, we did a specificity practice using classes and IDs - that was interesting. At the end of the practice, Leon had us give 2 pieces of content the highest specificity level possible. I thought I had it down, but didn't go as far as starting at the html element! It was cool to see it all work. <br>
• After finishing Class 05, I was able to do all 3 layouts without using any classes or IDs and felt great having whizzed through them faster than I expected. The satisfaction I got when it all laid out perfectly was awesome too.<br>


**< Today's Plan >**

• Start Class 06 lecture and write notion active recall notes.<br>
• IF I finish the lecture, I am going to try and knock out the homework assignment for Class 06.<br>

Side Note: If I finish Class 06 lecture today (Wednesday), I will be behind schedule and my personal goal!!! It'll give me time to catch up on the article readings from the last few classes 2 days early! I'm super proud of myself right now. WE GO GET!

### Day 61/100: July 15th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Finished Class 06 + submitted all homework! <br>

**< Thoughts >**

• Class 06 was pretty easy. We did a lot of active recall during the lecture and touched slightly on responsive website<br>


**< Today's Plan >**

• Start Class 07 lecture and write notion active recall notes.<br>
• Start Class 07 homework and get it submitted<br>
• Read prior articles assigned for homework on down time <br>

Side Note: In reference to finishing the articles, I felt like it was best I spent a majority of my time pushing forward in the lectures and reading the articles on my down time. I don't think putting off the lectures and learning materials with Leon for more than a couple days would benefit me and retaining all the information I'm learning. I'm also focused on catching up (but not rushing through any lessons either). 

---

### Day 62/100: July 16th, 2022

**< Yesterday's Progress >**

• Finished Class 07 + took a few class notes + a little active recall on new material. <br>

**< Thoughts >**

• Class 07 was nice. We touched a bit on networking and what to expect. We also learned how to make a responsive website with some practice. We went back and did some more code practice from previous lessons for active recall. It was a really productive class!<br>


**< Today's Plan >**

• Watch Independence Day movie for the assignment. <br>
• Go through the css tricks article and do flexbox froggy. <br>
• Code 3 media queries to make the 15 minutes of pain exercise from the previous lesson a responsive website. <br>
• Start Class 08 lecture and take active recall notes on notion.<br>
