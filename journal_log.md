< Thoughts >

• As a first time #100Dev'er, I was pulled into Leon's lecture almost immediately. He was extremely real and honest about how he felt. His willingness to help others break into tech without spending tons of money (especially for those who can't afford it) is inspiring. 

• The YouTube video were helpful, and shocking. I've heard of active recall, but never knew the science behind it. Ali Abdaal provided references from where he got his information from and graphs to help us visually see the difference in learning styles. I really appreciated how this is one of the very first things we learn before moving forward in #100Devs. 

< Today's Plan >
