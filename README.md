# 100Devs-Journal

Hello! 

Thank you for stopping by to check out my progress. I started with #100Devs on June 26th, 2022. As of that date, I was on Day 45/100 in #100DaysOfCode. 

I decided to track my coding journey with #100Devs through GitHub to really highlight my determination and willingness to learn, and show others that it is possible to break into tech with *great* free or low-cost online resources. I also would love to come back in a few years from now to see where I started. I'm sure future me will be so proud of herself for finally living out her dream and seeing how far she has come 🥹

The #100Devs community has been so helpful and amazing so far, and Leon is a such great teacher. I'm excited to meet and work with others as I progress!!
